# Sinatra College Textbooks

## Inspiration
College is expensive enough. Tuition is in the tens of grands, yet people also have to purchase textbooks, which may be as expensive as $200. If your purchase a textbook from the school bookstore and you want to resell it after the semester, you'll be lucky to get $20 for it at the bookstore. This is inspired to be a platform for college students to sell their used textbooks to each other to help each other avoid high costs for something students won't use that much.
